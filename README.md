# reactTo-my-portfolio
This is a repo that contains code for a react centered personal portfolio. 

## Description

- The motivation behind the project was to be able to implement some of the new skills I have developed as a beginner coder so that I can practice building my own website and showing off my work through a portfolio.
- I started this project as a way to provide examples of my work to future employers. In doing so, I will be able to let my work speak for itself in the future as I improve it.
- In modifying this project, I learned how to make an floating header,and  building a navigation bar with a hamburger menu.
